Hi, stranger! 👋🐑

I'm a new graduate developer 👶. Now working [@RFCX](https://github.com/rfcx) as Android developer.

I'm most specialized on Android, Kotlin and Java but still need to learn much more on them.

🌞 **Goals for 2020**

More understaning on Android and start learning on hybrid application development (Flutter or React Native)
